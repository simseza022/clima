A weather app

## Getting Started

This application uses the Open Weather API and pulls data from it, 

It displays the data in a more visually appealing way.

The objective was to learn
  1. How to use Dart to perform asynchronous tasks.
  2. Understand async and await.
  3. What APIs are and how to use them to get data from the internet.
  4. How to use the Geolocator package to get live location data for both iOS and Android.
